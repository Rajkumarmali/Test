# Collaborate on Schema Finalization and Seed Data Strategy — Detailed Guide

## 1. Schema Finalization

### What is Schema Finalization?

Schema finalization is the process of defining the exact structure of your database. This includes deciding on tables, columns, data types, keys, relationships, and constraints.

In a collaborative environment, this means developers work together to agree on a common data model so that each part of the application (backend logic, API, storage, and frontend) works harmoniously.

### Why is it Important?

- Prevents conflicting assumptions about the data structure.
- Avoids data duplication and inconsistency.
- Ensures database queries are optimized and maintainable.
- Simplifies code sharing and future enhancements.
- Helps manage data integrity through constraints.

### Steps to Collaborate on Schema Finalization

#### Step 1: Identify Entities and Relationships

- List the core entities relevant to your HR app, for example:
  - Employees
  - Roles
  - Departments
  - Attendance
  - Leave Requests
  - Payroll (optional)
- Define how these entities relate (one-to-many, many-to-many).
- Example: An employee belongs to one department, a department has many employees.

#### Step 2: Define Attributes for Each Entity

- Determine what data each table must store.
- For example, the **Employees** table might include:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `phone`
  - `role_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `department_id` (Foreign Key)
  - `date_of_joining`
- Agree on data types (e.g., TEXT, INTEGER, DATE).
- Decide which fields are mandatory (`NOT NULL`) or optional.

#### Step 3: Normalize the Schema

- Avoid redundant data by separating into multiple related tables.
- For instance, keep roles in a separate `roles` table and link employees with `role_id`.
- Use foreign keys to enforce relationships.

#### Step 4: Define Constraints and Indexes

- Apply constraints like `PRIMARY KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `FOREIGN KEY`.
- Create indexes on columns frequently used in queries for better performance (e.g., `email` in employees).
- Consider composite keys if needed.

#### Step 5: Create ER Diagrams

- Use tools like dbdiagram.io or draw.io.
- Visualize tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.
- Share diagrams with the team for feedback.

#### Step 6: Iterate and Review

- Share draft SQL scripts.
- Conduct code reviews or team discussions.
- Test schema with sample data.
- Adjust based on feedback and new requirements.

## 2. Seed Data Strategy

### What is Seed Data?

Seed data refers to the initial data populated into the database to allow the application to start with meaningful data for testing, demos, or default operations.

### Why Collaborate on Seed Data?

- Ensures all developers work with the same baseline data.
- Allows consistent testing scenarios.
- Helps identify schema issues early.
- Supports development of features relying on specific data setups.

### Steps to Collaborate on Seed Data

#### Step 1: Identify Key Data to Seed

- List minimum data required for testing and demo purposes.
- For example:
  - Roles: Admin, HR, Employee
  - Departments: IT, HR, Finance
  - Sample employees with various roles and departments
  - Sample attendance records
  - Leave requests with different statuses

#### Step 2: Decide Seed Data Format

- SQL INSERT scripts, or
- Programmatic insertion via ReactJS + Capacitor SQLite API
- JSON files to import and parse

#### Step 3: Write Idempotent Seed Scripts

- Seed scripts should be safe to run multiple times without creating duplicates.
- Use `INSERT OR IGNORE` or check for existing records before insertion.

#### Step 4: Organize Seed Data Modularly

- Group seed scripts by entity (roles.sql, employees.sql, attendance.sql).
- Run scripts in order to respect foreign key constraints.

#### Step 5: Automate Seeding in Development Workflow

- Add seed scripts to app initialization during development.
- Provide manual triggers for reseeding if needed.
- Document how to run seed scripts.

#### Step 6: Test Seed Data

- Verify all tables populate correctly.
- Check referential integrity.
- Ensure data covers major business scenarios.

## 3. Communication and Version Control

- Use Git branches and pull requests for schema and seed data changes.
- Document schema changes with clear commit messages.
- Maintain a CHANGELOG for schema and seed updates.
- Keep ER diagrams and seed files in the repo for easy access.

## 4. Potential Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                              | Solution                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Schema disagreement between devs     | Regular meetings, design documents, and prototypes          |
| Seed data duplication on re-run      | Use idempotent scripts (`INSERT OR IGNORE`)                  |
| Foreign key violations during seeding| Seed data in dependency order (roles → departments → employees) |
| Performance issues with large seeds  | Modular seeding and incremental data loading                 |
| Schema changes affecting seed data   | Version seed data files and update scripts accordingly       |

# Begin Abstraction of CRUD Operations into Reusable Service — Detailed Guide

## 1. What is Abstraction of CRUD Operations?
Abstraction means creating a generalized, reusable layer of code that performs Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations, so you don’t repeat database logic everywhere in your app. Instead, you interact with a well-defined service that handles all SQLite queries.

This helps improve maintainability, testability, and consistency.

## 2. Why Abstract CRUD Operations?
### Reusability: 

 - Write code once and use it everywhere.

### Separation of Concerns: 

  - Keep data access logic separate from UI or business logic.

### Simplify Testing: 

 - Easier to mock or test database interactions.

### Consistent Error Handling: 

  - Centralized place for catching and managing DB errors.

### Maintainability: 

 - Changes in DB schema or queries happen in one place only.

## 3. How to Begin Abstraction?
### Step 1: Define the Entities and Data Models
 
 - For your HR app, define data models for entities such as Employee, Role, Department, Attendance, etc.
 - Use TypeScript interfaces/types to define the shape of these data objects.

Example (TypeScript):
ts
Copy
Edit
interface Employee {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  role_id: number;
  department_id: number;
  date_of_joining: string; // ISO date string
}
### Step 2: Setup SQLite Connection Service
  
  - Create a service to open and manage the SQLite database connection.

   Use Capacitor SQLite plugin for ReactJS.

Example:
ts
Copy
Edit
import { CapacitorSQLite, SQLiteDBConnection } from '@capacitor-community/sqlite';

let db: SQLiteDBConnection;

export const openDatabase = async () => {
  db = await CapacitorSQLite.createConnection({database: 'hr_app_db', mode: 'no-encryption', version: 1});
  await db.open();
  return db;
};

export const closeDatabase = async () => {
  if (db) {
    await db.close();
    await CapacitorSQLite.releaseConnection({database: 'hr_app_db'});
  }
};
### Step 3: Create Generic CRUD Functions
 - Create reusable functions for CRUD that can be adapted for any table.

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
// Create (Insert)
async function insertRecord(table: string, data: object) {
  const keys = Object.keys(data).join(',');
  const values = Object.values(data);
  const placeholders = values.map(() => '?').join(',');
  
  const sql = `INSERT INTO ${table} (${keys}) VALUES (${placeholders})`;
  await db.run(sql, values);
}

// Read (Select)
async function getRecords(table: string, whereClause = '', params: any[] = []) {
  const sql = `SELECT * FROM ${table} ${whereClause}`;
  const res = await db.query(sql, params);
  return res.values;
}

// Update
async function updateRecord(table: string, data: object, whereClause: string, params: any[]) {
  const setClause = Object.keys(data).map(key => `${key} = ?`).join(',');
  const values = [...Object.values(data), ...params];
  
  const sql = `UPDATE ${table} SET ${setClause} WHERE ${whereClause}`;
  await db.run(sql, values);
}

// Delete
async function deleteRecord(table: string, whereClause: string, params: any[]) {
  const sql = `DELETE FROM ${table} WHERE ${whereClause}`;
  await db.run(sql, params);
}
### Step 4: Create Entity-Specific Services Using Generic CRUD
Wrap the generic CRUD operations into entity-specific services for clarity and better type safety.

Example: Employee Service

ts
Copy
Edit
const EMPLOYEE_TABLE = 'employees';

export async function addEmployee(employee: Employee) {
  return insertRecord(EMPLOYEE_TABLE, employee);
}

export async function getEmployees() {
  return getRecords(EMPLOYEE_TABLE);
}

export async function updateEmployee(id: number, updatedData: Partial<Employee>) {
  return updateRecord(EMPLOYEE_TABLE, updatedData, 'id = ?', [id]);
}

export async function deleteEmployee(id: number) {
  return deleteRecord(EMPLOYEE_TABLE, 'id = ?', [id]);
}
### Step 5: Handle Errors and Logging
Wrap all DB calls in try-catch blocks.

Log errors for debugging.

Return meaningful messages to the caller for UI feedback.

### Step 6: Unit Test Your Services
Write unit tests mocking the SQLite DB.

Test CRUD logic separately from UI.

Additional Tips
Transactions: For operations involving multiple queries, wrap them in transactions to maintain atomicity.

Pagination & Filtering: Add parameters to your read queries for efficient data retrieval.

Batch Inserts: For large seed data, support batch inserts to improve performance.

Versioning: Keep track of schema versions and migration scripts in this service.
